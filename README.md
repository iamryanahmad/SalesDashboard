Sharing a dummy sales dashboard over Global Superstore data I created recently!

Data analysts need to have strong dashboarding skills in order to identify key business KPIs. This helps in highlighting potential zones which could lead to higher growth and better performance. This dashboard is created using Microsoft PowerBI where it observes the global distribution of sales for the year 2012 to 2015.

It identifies zones with highest total sales along with their segmental distribution using a doughnut chart. Moreover, here I've added further granularity via a pie chart displaying market wise segregation. Further, key KPIs like overtime average delivery time and total return orders are also added using cards. Lasty, I have included bar charts to identify top 10 markets by profit, top 5 profit as well as loss making products as focal areas.
